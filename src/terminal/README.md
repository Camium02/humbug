# Terminal Module

This module provides a comprehensive terminal emulation framework with cross-platform support. It includes terminal state management, buffer handling, and platform-specific implementations for Unix and Windows systems.

## Files

### `terminal_base.py`
Abstract base class for platform-specific terminal implementations:

- **`TerminalBase`** - Abstract interface for terminal operations
  - Defines common terminal interface across platforms
  - Handles working directory management
  - Provides process lifecycle management
  - Supports window size updates
  - Abstract methods for platform-specific implementations

### `terminal_buffer.py`
Core terminal buffer management and text processing:

- **`TerminalBuffer`** - Manages terminal screen buffer and text content
  - Handles terminal screen buffer with scrollback support
  - Processes ANSI escape sequences and control characters
  - Manages cursor positioning and movement
  - Supports text formatting (colors, styles, etc.)
  - Implements efficient buffer operations for large outputs
  - Handles line wrapping and terminal resizing

### `terminal_factory.py`
Factory for creating platform-appropriate terminal instances:

- **`TerminalFactory`** - Creates terminal instances based on platform
  - Automatic platform detection (Unix/Windows)
  - Returns appropriate terminal implementation
  - Handles platform-specific initialization
  - Provides unified interface for terminal creation

### `terminal_line.py`
Represents individual lines in the terminal buffer:

- **`TerminalLine`** - Represents a single line in the terminal
  - Stores line content and formatting information
  - Handles character-level operations
  - Supports text attributes and styling
  - Manages line state and metadata

### `terminal_state.py`
Manages terminal state and configuration:

- **`TerminalState`** - Tracks terminal state and settings
  - Maintains cursor position and attributes
  - Handles terminal modes and settings
  - Manages scrolling regions and margins
  - Tracks terminal capabilities and features
  - Supports state persistence and restoration

### `unix_terminal.py`
Unix/Linux-specific terminal implementation:

- **`UnixTerminal`** - Terminal implementation for Unix-like systems
  - Uses PTY (pseudo-terminal) for process communication
  - Handles Unix-specific terminal features
  - Supports job control and signal handling
  - Implements Unix terminal I/O operations
  - Manages child process lifecycle

### `windows_terminal.py`
Windows-specific terminal implementation:

- **`WindowsTerminal`** - Terminal implementation for Windows systems
  - Uses Windows Console API for terminal operations
  - Handles Windows-specific terminal features
  - Supports Windows console modes and settings
  - Implements Windows terminal I/O operations
  - Manages Windows process creation and lifecycle

## Usage

The terminal module provides a complete terminal emulation solution:

1. **Terminal Creation**: Use `TerminalFactory` to create platform-appropriate terminals
2. **Process Management**: Start and manage terminal processes
3. **I/O Operations**: Handle input/output with the terminal process
4. **Buffer Management**: Access and manipulate terminal buffer content
5. **State Management**: Monitor and control terminal state
